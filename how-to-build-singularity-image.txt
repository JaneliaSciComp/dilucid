Singularity recipes and images for DeepLabCut

These are Singularity recipes (*.def) for DeepLabCut, and images
(*.simg) made from the recipes.

To run one of these containers, do, e.g.:

    singularity run --nv dlc.simg

(The --nv makes GPUs available inside the container.)

This will start a bash shell running within the container.  (You can
do 'ls /' and look for a file named 'singularity' to verify that you
are running within the container.)

bethge.def: Recipe for baseline Bethge Lab container.
bethge.simg: Image made via 'sudo singularity build bethge.simg
             bethge.def'

dlc.def: Recipe for DeepLabCut container.
dlc.simg: Image made via 'sudo singularity build dlc.simg
          dlc.def'

dlcr.def: Recipe for DeepLabCut container, including support for
          refinement GUI.
dlc.simg: Image made via 'sudo singularity build dlcr.simg
          dlcr.def'
